# Streamlink config file

# Please see the Streamlink CLI documentation for all available options:
# https://streamlink.github.io/cli.html#command-line-usage

# The format is option=value
# Lines starting with a # are considered comments and are ignored.

# All leading dashes need to be ignored,
# e.g. --default-stream=STREAM becomes default-stream=STREAM

# Option values must not be quoted, or quotes become part of the option's actual value.

# By default, Streamlink will attempt to locate VLC on your system
# and use that, but you can also specify the location of a player yourself.
# Here are a couple of common player paths:

# VLC
#player=C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe
#player=C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe

# MPC-HC
#player=C:\Program Files\MPC-HC\mpc-hc64.exe
#player=C:\Program Files (x86)\MPC-HC\mpc-hc.exe

# MPV
#player=C:\Program Files\mpv-x86_64\mpv.exe

# Custom player arguments can be set using the player-args option.
# Please see the documentation of the used player for its available arguments.

# VLC
#player-args=--no-one-instance --play-and-exit
#player-args=--qt-minimal-view
#player-args=--file-caching=5000

# MPC-HC
#player-args=/new /play /close

# MPV
#player-args=--keep-open=no --force-window=yes
#player-args=--no-border
#player-args=--cache=yes --demuxer-max-bytes=2M


# Custom player window titles can automatically be set when a supported player
# and plugin are used. The title option has several variables available, which
# can show the stream's author, category/game, title, URL, etc.
#title={author} - {category} - {title}


# Use this if you want to transport the stream to the player via a named pipe.
#player-fifo

# Use one of these if you want to transport the stream to the player via HTTP.
# The continuous option will allow the player to stop and resume the output.
#player-http
#player-continuous-http

# Use player-passthrough if you want Streamlink to only pass the resolved URL
# to your player and let it handle the transport of the stream itself.
# Please note that the player needs to support the streaming protocol
# and that custom stream implementations in plugins will become unavailable,
# same as buffering options and those which change the network behavior.
#player-passthrough=http,hls

# By default, Streamlink will close the player when the stream is over.
# Use this option to let the player stay or close itself instead.
#player-no-close

# Show the player's console output
#verbose-player

# FFMPEG is used to mux separate video and audio streams into a single
# stream, so that they can be played. The full or relative path to ffmpeg
# should be specified here.
#ffmpeg-ffmpeg=C:\Program Files (x86)\Streamlink\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe
#ffmpeg-ffmpeg=C:\Program Files\Streamlink\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe
ffmpeg-ffmpeg=C:\Users\matko\AppData\Local\Programs\Streamlink\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe

# Log level, default is info
#loglevel=debug

# Number of threads to use when streaming HLS streams
#stream-segment-threads=1
